Animate the dropzone on hover as a basic proof of concept

Fix image upload to either work during the creation of a new listing with tmp ids, or only be available to users on a seperate page once they have created the basic
listing info.

- Listing Info
- Images
- Location

Rename the confusing users.js in actions to be more about AUTHENTICATION ON LOAD

DONE

Add a model dialogue for errors / messages etc.
Add user profile page so user can edit their credentials, also that shows all their listings so they can edit them.
Change unique fields on listing else upsert isn't working, actually upsert sholdn't be used here a something like an email address should be unique, maybe add inline error checking to fields instead to preempively check for duplication before allowing user to post, also need to not use upsert on server incase of malicious use case.
